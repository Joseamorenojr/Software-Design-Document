# Software-Design-Document
The client, The Gaming Room, tasked Creative Technology Solutions (CTS) with developing a web-based version of their existing Android game, Draw It or Lose It. The software required was a scalable, cross-platform application accessible via multiple devices. It needed to maintain the core game mechanics while ensuring compatibility, security, and scalability for web-based deployment.
The key requirements that were requested were unique identifiers for games, teams, and players. Real-time validation for unique game and team names. Support for multiple teams and players per game. Scalability and compatibility across platforms (desktops, tablets, and mobile devices). Secure handling of user data and efficient performance under multiple users.
After thorough analysis of the created design document the documentation clearly outlined the system’s requirements, constraints, and recommendations, focusing on how they support scalability, security, and cross-platform functionality. Using a structured format with sections like requirements, architecture, and domain models ensured clarity and completeness. Recommendations for using cloud platforms, distributed systems, and secure communication methods were particularly well-researched and aligned with the client’s needs.
Creating the design document helped in clarifying objectives as using detailed requirements provided a clear roadmap for development. Identifying constraints by highlighting platform-specific limitations facilitated realistic planning. Lastly creating efficient development because a well-defined domain model and architecture allowed for smooth code implementation.
If one aspect were to be revised, it would be the evaluation section comparing operating platforms. While comprehensive, it could be enhanced with more quantitative metrics (e.g., cost comparisons or performance benchmarks). Adding a decision matrix to evaluate platforms against requirements could improve clarity and provide stronger justification for recommendations.
User needs were interpreted through the requirements and translated into features like unique identifiers, real-time validation, and multi-device compatibility. For instance, the need for unique game/team names ensured seamless multiplayer interactions without conflicts. Considering user needs is crucial because it ensures the software aligns with user expectations, enhances usability, and supports business goals.
The approach combined user-centric design by translating user needs into detailed user stories. Iterative planning by utilizing Agile principles for flexibility and responsiveness. Finally, it also used distributed systems architecture by designing for scalability and reliability.
Future Strategies would include prototyping which would give us the ability to build prototypes to validate requirements early with stakeholders. Modeling Tools such using  UML diagrams to visualize complex relationships like we did earlier in the course. Automated Testing to incorporate continuous testing to ensure quality during iterations. Finally feedback loops which would regularly gather and incorporate user feedback into the design.
This systematic approach ensures both technical and user requirements are met efficiently.
